<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Good day! I am Philip Anthony C. Barbosa, 29 years of age, a licensed Electronics Engineer and Electronics Technician.
  I am the eldest of my siblings, as well as the breadwinner of my family. For leisure, I love to travel and go to the beach,
  sometimes I go camping with my family. I also love to eat and try different kind of food and delicasies in any place I go.

<p>In my former position as a Regional Project Manager handling Primary Rehab Projects in Mindanao for Bamacom, Inc., I am expected
  to build my networks fast, utilize my initiative and resourcefulness, learn quickly, adapt to diverse environment, and prove my leadership abilities.
  I have handled multiple teams composed of technical and admin personnel. On a daily basis, I monitor the output of our ongoing project sites for our
  client (PLDT). We do constructions of aerial, underground, and bridge attachments of their existing Fiber Optic networks.<br>
  As a Regional Project Manager, I am expected to deliver outputs even with fewer resources so I had to take the initiative to provide reports and output.
  I was responsible for overseeing multiple projects across the island of Mindanao. In this role, I developed and implemented project plans, managed budgets,
  coordinated with cross-functional teams, and ensured the timely delivery of projects within budget.<br>
  I am also keen on details especially on the construction and documentation side as these will ensure the project completion in compliance with the standards given by the client.
</p>

<p>I always dreamnt for a stable job where I can support my family, this is the reason why I always stay motivated and persevere for more. But I also would want to learn more things
  to elevate my skills. The eagerness to learn is always there and I expect in this position that I will enjoy the process of learning. Healthy working environment is also a plus for me
  where I can showcase my full potential and contribute my skills and learnings.
